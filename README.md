# Wage_Gap_Study
My first Data Science project, created in 2020, posted to GITHUB 2023.
Focuses on the Wage Gap and Women's Rights.


Is gender inequality still prevalent in the industrialized/developed nations? 
If so, what are the main factors contributing to it's common issues, such as the wage gap?

The large portion will primarily be based on the US to slim the data for more precise results.

Background and Motivation
According to American Association of University Women, women working full time in the U.S. are still paid just 83 cents to every dollar earned by men. Many studies have been generated over the years that show a gradual decrease in the wage gap, and increase in Women in STEM fields, as well as an increase of women in the workforce overall. While these studies and statistics are undoubtedly a good thing, what does this data truly represent? What can we infer from a statistical analysis of women in the workforce overtime? Census data and statistical reporting, as well as educational analysis articles, all seem to have a variety of answers to why the percent pay difference between men and women is so prominent. They range from gender biases about women not willing to work in STEM based careers, from lack of access to education, violence and sexual harassment in the workplace, and universities or employers not having environmental accommodations to promote women into STEM fields, among many more. The issues for women don't just start and stop at the monetary disparities. Women experience unique and unfortunate circumstances that hinder them greatly, all around the world. Historically, in many countries, women lacked access to proper education, civil liberties, positions of power, and experienced forms of sexual/physical violence (such as child marriage, domestic abuse, etc.) Are they still occurring in todayâ€™s world? If so, are these occurrences also decreasing overtime? This project will be used to dig deeper into what issues effect women today, as well as what aspects of the world contribute to them. I will be looking into data from The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, CORGIS Global Set, as well as UN Global Data, and comparing my results to articles, government statistics, and college research papers to come to conclusions on the following questions:

1. Is the Wage Gap still occurring, and what are it's root causes?

2. Is gender inequality as prevalent in the US as it is to other less developed nations?

3. What other gender inequality issues are common besides the wage gap?
